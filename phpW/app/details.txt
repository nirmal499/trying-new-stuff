1. The server will start in 'web' directory and not in the parent directory (/app)

web/index.php: This is the server document root containing the single entry point file for HTTP
requests. Every file in 'web' directory can be accessed through the server

index.php: This file is responsible for accepting all HTTP requests and producing and
returning HTTP responses; it includes all the necessary script files of the application
and runs specific tasks to achieve its purpose (for example, returning the HTTP
response).

2. The 'src' directory contains the business logic and presentation files of the
application; This directory is not exposed to WWW; however, the scripts will run for each request, since they are included in web/index.php,
which means that they are indirectly exposed to user input

3. src/components/{Router.php,Template.php}

Router.php: The Router component is responsible for picking a handler (that is, a class
name) to instantiate and returning it. Essentially, it will match a URI path to a handler
class (for example, /login will result in returning the \Handlers\Login instance)

Template.php: The Template component is responsible for loading and rendering a
template from the 'templates' directory and returning the HTML content.

4. src/handlers

This directory contains the scripts with classes that will process the HTTP request
and will generate response data. This directory has an abstract Handler class that
implements some common functionality, which will be extended by actual handlers.
The previously listed handlers are meant to cover the authentication (Login.php), secure
the profile page, log out of any session (Logout.php), and protect the profile page display
(Profile.php)
