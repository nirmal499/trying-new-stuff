1. php -S localhost:port_number

2. localhost opened on that port_number treats the directory where it was
started as the main directory. So, what ever file there is the main directory
, you can access it in localhost:port_number/your_file.php

3. Suppose there is a file named as 'file_name_1.php' , then you can access it using 
localhost:port_number/file_name_1.php . This can only happen if you have placed the
file_name_1.php in the main directory [ The main directory is the directory from where you have
    launched the localhost:port_number using the command shown in point 1 ]
