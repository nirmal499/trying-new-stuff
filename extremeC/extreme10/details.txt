Using the first approach, we kept a structure variable as the first field in the
child's attribute structure. Now, using the second approach, we'll keep a pointer
to the parent's structure variable. This way, the child class can be independent
of the implementation of the parent class, which is a good thing, considering
information-hiding concerns.
