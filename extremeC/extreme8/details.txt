AGGREGATION:
Aggregation also involves a container object that contains another object. The
main difference is that in aggregation, the lifetime of the contained object is
independent of the lifetime of the container object.
In aggregation, the contained object could be constructed even before the
container object is constructed. This is opposite to composition, in which the
contained object should have a lifetime shorter than or equal to the container
object
